# CoffeeTracker

This project serves as a straightforward coffee consumption tracker. Utilizing Angular for the front-end and a C# Web API for back-end functionality, it displays and manages coffee consumption data. 
I built this project primarily to solidify my understanding of Angular fundamentals.    
The interface allows users to filter table data based on ID, date, or quantity. Additionally, users can perform essential CRUD operations.
